## Evolution of Web

### Hi everyone,

#### Today I am going to talk about the origin and evolution of the modern web, from the early stages of Web 1.0 to the modern Web 3.0. The internet has come a long way since its origin, transforming how we interact, share information, and conduct business. Let's dive into this fascinating journey.

#### Let’s begin with Web 1.0. The Web 1.0, also referred to as the static web, began in the early 1990s and lasted until the early 2000s. During that period, websites were basically static pages with a bunch of information. Users could only read and view information without interacting too much. Hyperlinks were the primary method for navigating between pages. We can still see glimpses of Web 1.0 in Wikipedia and Craigslist to this day. It was a minimal experience of the web.

### Now, let’s move to Web 2.0.

#### Web 2.0, also referred to as the dynamic web, originated in the mid-2000s, approximately from 2003 onwards. Around that time, current tech giants like Facebook and Microsoft also emerged. Web 2.0 is the web version you and I are browsing presently. Web 2.0 introduced dynamic content and social media, focusing more on user interaction with websites. Now we can create and share our own content on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. We can also communicate with each other from any corner of the world using chat applications and social media platforms.

#### It’s all happening thanks to Web 2.0.

#### But as they say, everything comes with a disadvantage, and Web 2.0 is no exception. The main concern is privacy. You all know we use major websites or platforms for free. It’s great, right? But have you ever wondered how these big companies survive? Have you noticed the personalized ads coming to your social feeds? Now you get it—these companies mainly sell or exchange our personal data to several companies for advertisement purposes. And the main concern is that these small companies are owned by large parent companies. Those giants gain full control over user data and online interactions. Think about Google. How many products do we use from Google? Now, can you even imagine switching to another search engine?

### So, how can we overcome this problem? This thought leads to the evolution of Web 3.0.

#### Web 3.0, often called the decentralized web, represents the next generation of the internet. It aims to create a user-centric, secure, and transparent online environment.

#### In Web 3.0, decentralization means that control and ownership of data and applications are distributed across a network of nodes rather than being centralized in a single entity. This method ensures users have more control over their data and interactions online. That's why, in Web 3.0, no monopoly tech giants can control or manipulate our systems. Web 3.0 also involves evolving blockchain technology.

#### Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that records transactions across many computers rather than a single server. Because of this, data recorded in a blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, and all transactions are visible to participants, building trust and accountability.

#### Presently, one of the major blockchain networks is Ethereum, and there are more evolving.

#### As I mentioned before, Web 3.0 also has some disadvantages. The main one is complexity. For a normal user, it's difficult to understand and use Web 3.0 technology efficiently. Another is scalability. As of now, blockchain networks face challenges in handling large volumes of transactions smoothly.

#### Although Web 3.0 represents a significant shift towards a more decentralized, user-focused, and secure internet, it still has hurdles to overcome.

#### Hope Web 3.0 can break those barriers, and we can experience a safe, privacy-oriented internet in the future. Thank you for your attention. Bye.
