# LINUX

Every computer needs an operating system (OS). When we think about OS, the first names that come to mind are Windows and macOS. However, if your priorities are lightweight, secure, and free software, then the best answer is Linux OS.

Linux is widely used in cloud environments, including Microsoft Azure, where a significant portion of workloads run on Linux. You may not realize it, but if you're using an Android device, its kernel is also built on Linux.

In this video, I will talk about what Linux OS is, its benefits, history, distributions, future, and the certifications you can pursue in Linux.

Let's start with the history. Many people think Linux is an extended version of UNIX OS. The answer is no. UNIX is an OS built in 1969 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, who also created the C programming language. UNIX had many variants, one of which was Minix, used for educational purposes. Using Minix as an inspiration, Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel from scratch. The kernel is the heart of the OS. By adding the GNU environment to the Linux kernel, we now have the Linux OS we use today.

Now, let's talk about Linux distributions, or distros. Linux has an open-source architecture, meaning the source code of the Linux kernel is available for everyone to modify and create versions. There are hundreds of Linux distros in the world right now. Some of the most famous are Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat Linux, and Linux Mint. Personally, I have been running Linux Mint on my laptop for the past two years.

Next, let's discuss the perks of Linux:

**Linux is free** - This makes it ideal for cloud environments, as it can be used without cost.
**Performance** - Some Linux distros can easily run on old laptops or PCs, which is why IoT devices also use Linux.
**Stability** - Linux is one of the most stable operating systems available.
**Transparency and Privacy** - As I mentioned, Linux's architecture is open source, allowing us to adjust our privacy settings. We can decide whether to share our data with specific software.
**C**ustomization** - With hundreds of distros, all are custom-built, offering a variety of options to suit different needs.
**Command Line Interface** - Linux allows us to perform complex tasks easily through the command line.
**Portability** - We can carry our complete Linux configuration on a simple USB drive.
**Learning Opportunities** - Linux provides tremendous learning opportunities for those who want to study it.
**Community Support** - Linux has one of the best communities for support and collaboration.

We can also pursue certifications in Linux to advance our careers. Some of the prominent certifications include:

**Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)**
**CompTIA Linux+**
**Oracle Linux Certification**
